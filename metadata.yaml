description: In 1898 Lawrence Cole submitted The Basis of Early Christian Theism as
  partial fulfillment for the requirements for a PhD in Philosophy at Columbia University.
  Theism is a doctrine concerning the nature of God and his relationship to the universe.
  God is seen as personal and active in the organization of the Universe. Cole begins
  by saying, ""In accounts of the theistic argument, as in the history of philosophy
  in general, it has been customary to pass over a space of well-nigh ten centuries
  of the Christian era in silence, or with such scanty and unsympathetic notice as
  to make silence the be.
